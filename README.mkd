XDate
=====

XDate is a lightweight wrapper around JavaScript's Date object.
It adds commonly needed functionality for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates.

Most importantly, it will hold any date you give it.
Unlike JavaScript's Date Object, it is immune to DST gaps.
This ensures your dates behave consistently across every browser in the world.
